#Artificial Neural Network Classifier
An Artificial Neural	Network 	Classifier is learned on a Banking Dataset to provide a  probability of a client to  churn.
The dataset which we will be used to perform a classification task consists of details of customers of a bank whose customers are based in the countries: Spain, France, and Germany. 
It consists of 10,000 rows and 14 columns. The target variable is a column named ‘Exited’ which represents whether a customer has left the bank or not (Binary variable).
